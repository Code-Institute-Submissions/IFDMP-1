<p>Let me tell you a little story a bout a little hermit Crab named Herm I.T

Herm was born around 1978 and felt alive and kicking 

However, after 40 years of roaming around on beaches and talking to ot her crabs, he felt tghe world around him had changed to much

Herm just wanted to hide, stay away from all this supe rficial coloured sand

Herm just wanted to stay in his light brown sand

So now Herm is hiding and everytime yo u think you found him, he will hide again and make himself a little bit smaller
How many time will you be able to find Herm?
Good luck you will always find him eventually</p>
